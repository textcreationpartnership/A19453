         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But now to pa≈ø≈øe further in our di≈øcour≈øes, tho≈øe men whom Nature cau≈øeth their Children to be fooles, in my Iudgement hapneth not by the birth, but by the bringing vp, the which is the cau≈øe that many great heads by long practi≈øe, become readie witted. And other who euer in their cradles are ≈øound to haue a quick wit, in proce≈ø≈øe of time, either through idlenes, or gluttony, or ≈øome ≈øuch mi≈ø-gouerment, become ≈ølow and dull headed: Now from that con≈øideration, I would come to this, that the father, who through much trauell and trouble, both of body and
<pb facs="tcp:5364:7"/>minde, hath gotten wealth and honour, though be getteth children of great wit, yet he is ≈øo ouer-gone in latherly affection towards them, that knowing he hath prouided for them ≈øufficiently to liue by at their ca≈øe, he cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to ≈øee them trauell and labour as he hath done, ≈øo that vanqui≈øhed with a certaine tender effectien, he ≈øuffereth them to be brought vp dillicately, and wantonly, and is the cau≈øe, that by this idlenes their naturall force decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and by Cu≈øtome is quite chaunged into an other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider this al≈øo be≈øides, how that many Children peceiuing and knowing very well, them ≈øelues to be thus pampred vp by their Parents, keepe them-≈øelues ≈øo much as they way out of the Du≈øt a Sun: neyther care they for applying their thindes, to any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mendable thing, nor for to ≈øeeke to get any more Riches or ≈øub≈øtance, then that which their Parents haue with great diligence formerly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them: but here it may be truely ≈øaid of them, that they are not vn-like the Crowe who liveth onely by ≈øuch Fonde as other Bea≈øtes a Cattle do u≈øually leane: &amp; ≈øurely there is no doubt of it, but if that they were meanely lefte by their parents (as many poore mens Children often are) then would they grow to be exceeding prudent &amp; wi≈øe, and then would they be rich &amp; ≈øufficiently able to liue in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>

            <p>Yet we ≈øee that women are glad to meate with hu≈øbands that are gentle natured, and a little fooli≈øh, that they may keepe them vnder.</p>

            <p>A man may well giue women this good Coun≈øell, but there be fewe of them that will be ≈øo good as follow it: and which ≈øeeke not ≈øtill to beare rule ouer their hu≈øbands.</p>
            <p>It is a thing rea≈øonable and agreeable to nature, that the ≈øtronger ≈øhould commaund ouer the weaker: yet ≈øome women haue the right quality to order things ≈øo well that their hu≈øbands ≈øhould be thought to wrong them greatly, if they ≈øhould finde fault with them.</p>
            <p>Where vpon Cato was wont to ≈øay to the <hi>Romans:</hi> we commaund ouer all the world, and wiues commaund ouer vs: and ≈øurely there is no doubt, but that many rulers and gouernours of Citties and Countryes, are ouer-ruled by their wiues: But as tho≈øe women know how in time and place to be obedient to their hu≈øbands: So there are ≈øome ≈øuch ≈øhameles women, that they will not at any time be commanded, but by their exclamations, ≈øcolding and braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, continually: alwayes with-≈øtanding their hu≈øbands wils, and make a mock at them, playing with them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand ≈øhrewd prankes, which cau≈øed a certaine King to ≈øay that they were very fooles, that would follow their wiues running away.</p>
            <p>This ≈øaying puts me in minde of a mery Ie≈øt of a hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who, his wife hauing drowned her≈øelfe in a Riuer, went crying along the Riuer ≈øide, ≈øeeking her again≈øt the ≈øtreame: and being tolde that there was no que≈øtion, but that ≈øhe was gone downe with the ≈øtreame.

            <p>But in an other ≈øort, now if the woman ≈ø√©e her hu≈øband faile in the loue, which he oweth her, yet ≈øhe mu≈øt not do as he doth, but ≈øupply vertuou≈øly his default: ≈øhewing to the worlde, that for her part, ≈øhe beareth the cro≈ø≈øe her ≈øelfe, which doing ≈øhe ≈øhall haue double rewad of God, &amp; double prai≈øe of the world: wherby you may gather that the breach of honour is committed more to the diligence and tru≈øt of the wife, then of the hu≈øband, and though the hu≈øband offend God as muth as the wife, in violating the ≈øacred band of Matrimony: Yet the wife ought firmely to print this in her hart, and to remember alwaies, that where the hu≈øband by his fault doth but a little blemi≈øh his credit, the wife altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loo≈øeth her good name, and remaineth ≈øpotted with ≈øuch infamy, that ≈øhe can neuer recouer her honour againe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any repentance, nor by amendment of her life.</p>
            <p>Therefore let a wife woman ≈øiop her eares again≈øt the alurements of tho≈øe which lye in waight for her cha≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and to k√©ept more ≈øafely her hone≈øtie both in deede

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST</hi> it is to be con≈øidered that Children bring ≈ømall or no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to their Parents, if Nature and Fortune be not well temperd in them: For as a fruitful graine ≈øowen in a ≈øoyle vnfit for it, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth foorth no increa≈øe: So a child that is naturally giuen to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, will neuer doe well, if be be fet to hu≈øbandry: ≈øo much it behooueth the father to find out in his Childe-hood, wherevnto he is mo≈øt inclined.</p>
            <p>Therefore it behooueth fathers to v≈øe di≈øcretion in this
<pb facs="tcp:5364:21"/>poynt, that is to finde out the naturall inclination of their children, the which is be≈øt done in their Infancy, as the prouerbe is, that by the morning it may be gathered, how all the day will proue after, whether it will be eyther faire or foule.</p>
            <p>I thinke this coun≈øell mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary to be re≈øpected by the fathers, who force their Children to enter into trade of life, which is altogether contrary to their mindes, and therefore no maruaile though they receiue ≈ømall comfort of them: For thereof many times in≈øueth the di≈øhonor of their hou≈øe, and which is wor≈øe great offence towardes God, as when poore boyes are put to ≈øtudy diuinitie, who euen from their mothers wombe de≈øire the warres.</p>
            <p>Tho≈øe fathers that ≈øet their children to things contrary to their di≈øpo≈øition, are rather to be pittied then blamed: for that happeneth commonly for lacke of taking hade, but tho≈øe which thru≈øt their children into Colledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are of yeares, to choo≈øe or refu≈øe that life: Are no doubt greatly to be blamed for that they bring their children too it, eyther through feare, or through fal≈øe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øions: which is nothing el≈øe, but to with≈øtand the will of God, and ≈øo take from their children that free choyce which God of his diuine goodnes, hath promi≈øed them.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the father be carefull of the loue and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of his hou≈øe, let him be al≈øo carefull to know whether his ≈øonnes mindes, be giuen eyther to learning, or to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or to hu≈øbandry, or to marchandize, and when hee ≈øhall perceiue he hath drawne him out of the right, let him make him returne into it forthwith, and ≈øet him againe where he ≈øhould be, otherwi≈øe let him a≈ø≈øure him≈øelfe, that a thing ill begun will come to a wor≈øe end.</p>

            <p>I am of mind without doubt, that the effects of the milke is maruelous, and it is a thing certaine, that if a lambe be nouri≈øhed with the milke of a Goate, or a Kidd with the milke of a yeaw, the Kidd will haue a very ≈øoft hayre, and the Lambe a very rough and barry wooll.</p>

            <p>Whereof it commeth often to pa≈ø≈øe, that the children fa≈øhioning them≈øelues to the humours of their nur≈øes, ≈øwarue from the loue and dutie they owe to their mothers, and haue not in them the bloud which moueth then: to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: which is manife≈øt by the example of a ba≈øtard in <hi>Italy,</hi> who returning from the warres laden with the ≈øpoyles of

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT</hi> now let vs goe forward, to ≈øhew the occa≈øions of the difference betweene the fathers and their children, holding for certaine, that the difference procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the trade of life the childe is ≈øet too, and therefore I ≈øay, that it is not enough for the father to know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
<pb facs="tcp:5364:23"/>his child is not naturally giuen: if afterward he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour not to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him, and carefully to prouide to place him in that Art or Science that he mo≈øt de≈øires.</p>
            <p>Another cau≈øe of this difference betw√©ene the father and the childe, is when the father loueth him≈øelfe better then his child keeping him with him to play withall, without taking any care to ≈øet him to ma≈øters which may in≈øtruct him in Learning, or to the Court, or to tho≈øe profe≈ø≈øions, wherevnto his mind is mo≈øt inclined.</p>
            <p>In this many wealthy fathers greatly offend, who beare them≈øelues bolde vpon their goods, and neuer take care for the bringing vp of their children, in learning and vertue, but ≈øuffer their wits to be dulled with idlenes, and gluttony, that (as the prouerbe is) they know not chaffe from corne, but grow to haue as good iudgement as the A≈ø≈øe, which iudged the Cuckoes ≈øinging, to be more ≈øweets then the Nightingales: but now ≈øome will ≈øay, that the more the father k√©epeth his children about him the more he maketh their manners like to his.</p>
            <p>But ≈øuch men are deceiued, for the life of the olde father is no patterne for the young ≈øonne to ≈øhape his doings by: and be≈øides in time he will accu≈øe his father, for that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing oppertunitie to ≈øend him abroad to get wealth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimation, he kept him at home, and thereby hindreth his preferment: Therefore tho≈øe fathers that loue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will not by keeping them vnder their wings, hinder their preferment, for in my iudgement the father ≈øhewes his child the greater figne of good will, in letting them goe from him, then in keeping him at home, for thereby he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his childs profit before his owne, and if he loue him as he ought by nature: he mu≈øt al≈øo loue his preferment, and ≈ø√©eke to better his e≈øtate, liking better that be ≈øhould dye like a hor≈øe in a battell, then liue like a bogge in the mire.</p>
            <p>I haue yet made no mention of fathers, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb facs="tcp:5364:23"/>with learning, ≈øufficient to make his childe partaker of his knowledge, for ind√©ed they be very rare, and if there be any ≈øuch, yet they will not or they cannot take ≈øuch paines, nor tye them≈øelues to ≈øuch a charge, hauing other bu≈øines.</p>
            <p>Marry if they would vndertake it, there is no doubt but great good would come of it, for that the father would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct the child more carefully, and the child would receiue it more haedefully of his father, then of his mai≈øter.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Cato</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> him≈øelfe taught his ≈øonne, and brought him to great perfection, without the helpe of any gouernour or mai≈øter.</p>
            <p>Likewi≈øe <hi>Octauian Augu≈øtus</hi> being Emperour tooke no ≈øcorne to teach his two adoptine ≈øonnes: but the iniquitie of this our time is ≈øach, that men would count it a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterous thing to ≈øee a father being a gentleman to teach his ≈øonne, but the ≈øhame of tho≈øe fathers is greater, who being neither ≈øufficient nor willing to teach their children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues take no care to put them out to be in≈øtructed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ≈øuch men in my iudgement are very ≈øimple, and know not the difference betweene the learned and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
            <p>Yet for all that, the abu≈øe of this age is ≈øuch, that the men of our time, will not haue their ≈øonnes breake their heads with ≈øtudy and in a manner mi≈ølike that they ≈øhould reade, forgetting quite, that the ignorant in compari≈øon of the learned, are wor≈øe then dead, and that rich men without learning, are budies without minds, and tearmed by Diogines, ≈øheepe with golden fleects: and therefore they ought to be more carefull to in≈øtruct their children in learning, for as the poore are driuen to ≈øtudy by nece≈ø≈øity, ≈øo the rich are hindred from it by ≈øuperfluitie: and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider not vntill it be too late, that learning is more nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for rich men, then for poore: for the rich haue more dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the world, and haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>For the wi≈øedome of the world, is folly with God, and it is a thing impo≈ø≈øible for him to liue well that knoweth not God.</p>
            <p>Therefore I would haue parents to take care both for the minde and body of their Children: but becau≈øe the minde beeing the more excellent, it is rea≈øon to ca≈øt out
<pb facs="tcp:5364:25"/>ch√©efe≈øt care vpon it.</p>
            <p>And for that the minde in Infants is like a table booke wherein nothing is written, and like a tender twig which may be bowed euery way, it is cleare, that vertue or vice may be ea≈øily planted in it, and for that it is knowne by proofe, that the≈øe things are kept be≈øt in memory, which are learned in youth: Fathers ought to in≈øtruct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the be≈øt thing they can, e≈øpecially in the feare and loue of God, holding it for a generall rule, that he which knoweth euery thing, and knoweth not God, knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but if the father be diligent to in≈øtruct his children in the Lawe of God, he ≈øhall get his ioy by it, that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren thereby will doe him the more honour and reuerence, knowing that it is gods will they ≈øhould do ≈øo.</p>
            <p>But now let vs returne againe to the former occa≈øion of the ill ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of children, to which may be added this, when the father ≈øetteth before them a ≈øtayned and ≈øpotted gla≈ø≈øe to looke in, that is, when he giueth them ill example, which the Romanes were very circum≈øpect in, who≈øe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øty was ≈øo great, that the father would neuer bathe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe in the company of his ≈øonne, for it is counted a great fault in the father, to ≈øuffer him≈øelfe to be ≈ø√©ene naked by his ≈øonne.</p>
            <p>It is no maruaile though <hi>Cato</hi> put <hi>Manlius</hi> out of the Senat of <hi>Rome,</hi> onely for ki≈ø≈øing his wife in the pre≈øence of his daughter.</p>

            <p>Likewi≈øe it the father be hone≈øt and the ≈øonne lewd, the fathers good name is called in que≈øtion through the ≈øonnes folly.</p>
            <p>And many men thinke it vnpo≈ø≈øible that the ≈øonne ≈øhould tread awry, vnles he were by his father led thereto.</p>
            <p>And thereupon it is thought, that tho≈øe men which v≈øe too extreame ≈øeueritie towardes their children is not done ≈øo much vpon di≈øplea≈øure that take again≈øt them, as for the care then haue to maintaine their owne credit.</p>
            <p>I would therefore haue all fathers to frame them≈øelues to line well and orderly, as well for their owne ≈øakes, as for the venefit of their children, who ≈øeeing vertue ≈øhining in their fathers deeds, will haue a de≈øire in all goodnes to follow their ≈øteps.</p>
            <p>For when children ≈ø√©e their fathers ≈øeruants of the hou≈øe ≈øtand renerently waiting vpon him, and ready at the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of his finger, to do his commaundements, they will thereby take example to doe their duile likewi≈øe, and not be le≈ø≈øe obedient then leruants and ≈øtraungers, and be≈øides indeauour to be like to their father in deedes, that they may in time to come receiue the like reuerence of their ≈øeruants, as they ≈øee their father doe of his: For the father that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth an ill example to the child, in time ≈øhall be had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by the child, ≈øo that be ≈øhall neyther receiue ≈øuccour of him in his latter dayes, nor at his death, that la≈øt duty to clo≈øe vp his eyes: be≈øides the father liuing di≈øorderly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times make hand of tho≈øe goods which his Children ≈øhould liue by.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:5364:27"/>affection and di≈øcretion: and according to the olde ≈øaying, it is an hard matter for a mother to be fond of her children, and wi≈øe both together: but yet the right loue, is to beate and correct them when they ≈øhall de≈øerue it, for certainely the rod doth not te≈ø≈øen the mothers loue, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe it, for if the exce≈ø≈øe of loue be to be blamed in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much more is it to be reproued in the father: whe≈øe part it is ito examine and correct his childrens faults, a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him≈øelfe the onely way to ≈øpoyle them, is to be too much fond and tender ouer them.</p>
            <p>But now I mu≈øt tell you, which be the≈øe fathers, that I call more then fathers, in my oppinion they be tho≈øe, which are too cruell to their children, and beate them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually like ≈ølaues for the lea≈øt fault in the world.</p>
            <p>Truely tho≈øe fathers are to be mi≈øliked of all men, for that without any di≈øcretion they mea≈øure their children by them≈øelues, and require at their hands a matter impo≈ø≈øible, whch is to haue them be olde in their youth, not ≈øuffering them to inioy that liberty which is alowed to their age and in my minde, they de≈øcrue no other name then of Schoole-mai≈øters, for that they cannot manner their children well, vnle≈ø≈øe they haue a rod in their hand: for if they were right fathers they would be content that their children ≈øhoulde learne of them nothing el≈øe but to refrayne from doing ill, and to v≈øe to doe that which is good and hone≈øt, which a childe is brought too, rather by loue then by force: but the authoritie which ≈øome vn-wi≈øe fathers take vpon them is ≈øo great, that without re≈øpecting age, time, or place they will heepe their children vnder by force, and make them doe enery thing contrary to nature, yea euen to wear their apparell after the fa≈øhion of the good men of the time pa≈øt.</p>
            <p>In this they doe ami≈ø≈øe, and hereby they make their children not to loue them har≈øely, and to obey them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feare then affection: And be≈øides, they con≈øider not that the beating without mea≈øure, and the keeping

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Like tho≈øe fathers well, that can keepe their children in awe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ≈øhakeing their head at them, or v≈øing ≈øome ≈øuch like ≈øigne and can onely with a word correct them, and make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhamed of their fault: yet I am per≈øwaded that there are few fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that know how to keepe the meane, but they will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be too rough or too gentle to their children, whereof as the one driues them to de≈øperatenes, ≈øo the other brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to wantonnes.</p>
            <p>We mu≈øt thinke that a childe hath giuen vnto him a father and a mother, to the end that of the wi≈øedome of the one and the loue of the other, that meane I ≈øpeak of might be made, and that the ≈øeueritie of the father may be ≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what mittigated by the leuity of the mother.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:5364:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Now this calls to mind an other di≈øagr√©ement betw√©en the father and the childe, which is the partiall loue of the father towardes his children: for in my minde it is a great fault that he ≈øhould loue one more then an other, and that all being of his fle≈øh and bloud, he ≈øhould ca≈øt a merry countenance vpon ≈øome of them, and an angry looke vpon other ≈øome.</p>
            <p>Yet this is the nature of man, that a father loneth not all his children alike, and yet he whom he loueth lea≈øt, cannot iu≈øtly complaine of him: for the in-equality of loue is permitted to the fathers affection.</p>
            <p>A father that is a hu≈øbandman, hauing one ≈øonne a ≈øchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, an other a Marchant, and an other a hu≈øbandman, of tho≈øe three it is a great chaunce but hee will loue the hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman be≈øt, for he ≈øeeth him like him≈øelfe in life and manners, wherein his other ≈øonnes in duty mu≈øt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: for by nature we are led to like tho≈øe things which re≈øemble vs mo≈øt: Oh how hard a thing it is for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after partiall loue is once entered into his hart, to giue iu≈øtice indifferently.</p>
            <p>The greater is the wi≈øedome of the father, who prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the de≈øerts of his children, before his owne partiall loue maketh his ≈øences yeeld to rea≈øon, and ≈øheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe in deeds a like towards all.</p>
            <p>I will not deny, but the father by his authoritie may di≈øtribute his fauours as he ≈øeeth good, to one more, to an other le≈ø≈øe, according to the ≈øtate and doings of his children, for as by gentle v≈øage he incourageth a child that is well, giuen to doe well ≈øo by hard handling, he may bring one that is vntoward to goodnes: Yea if he haue any childe that is pa≈øt grace, without any hope of recouerie, he may lawfully not onely loue him le≈ø≈øe then the re≈øt, but quite ca≈øt him out of his fauour.</p>
            <p>But tho≈øe fathers are greatly to be blamed, who with vniu≈øt partiality, and without any rea≈øonable con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:5364:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>on will v≈øe one child as ligetimate, the other vnlawfull: whereof it followeth, that he which is ≈øo meanely accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, doth not onely fayle in affection to his kindred, but beginneth to fall to ≈øecret warre, with his owne brothers: whereby the father that might e≈øtabli≈øh peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among≈øt his children, ≈øhall by his partiality plant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them a roote of continaull di≈øcord: Therefore the father ought to be well adui≈øed how he preferreth in good will one childe before an other, and not to doe it vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery light occa≈øion</p>
            <p>I likewi≈øe thinke it a great folly in≈øome fathers, that make ≈øome of their children their darling and minion with out ≈øeeing any towardnes in them in the world, and let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to haue knowledge of their fond &amp; cau≈øles affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet it often falleth out that tho≈øe children by rea≈øon of their wanton and dilicate bringing vp, proue doults and ≈øimple ≈øotts: whereas contratiwi≈øe tho≈øe which are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed from their fathers loue, and driuen to ≈øhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, doe oftentimes by their owne paine and trauell, ≈øo aduaunce their e≈øtates that they are in better ca≈øe, then their father or their lawfull brothers, to whom oft-times they afford ayde and ≈øuccour in their di≈øtre≈ø≈øes: we may boldely then ≈øay, that the in-iu≈øtice of the father, br√©edeth di≈øagreement betweene his children and him≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>But now againe to our purpo≈øe: It is commonly ≈øeene, and that for the mo≈øt part tho≈øe children which are mo≈øt made of, fall out the wor≈øt, and haue many mi≈øfortunes: which makes me remember a prety Ie≈øt of an Ape that had two young ones at a litter, whereof ≈øhe loued the one, and cared nothing for the other: which Ape vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion was driuen from her den, and hauing taken that which ≈øhe loued in her armes, and tyed the other at her backe, in running ≈øhe ≈øtumbled and fell howne again≈øt the hard ground, and ≈øo killed her young one, ≈øhe had in her armes, and loued ≈øo well, but the other which was at her backe
<pb facs="tcp:5364:29"/>had no harme at all whereby we may ≈øee that the Father oftimes doth pennance for his fondnes.</p>
            <p>But to returne to our matter, there is yet remaining one occa≈øion of the di≈øagreement betweene the Father and the Childe, which is when the Father will not ≈øuffer his Children to come forth of their Infancy, meaning that when eyther thorough the authoritie of olde age, or couet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hereof will ri≈øe thr√©e good effects: the fir≈øt is the loue of the ≈øonne, who ≈øeeing his father withdraw him≈øelfe by litle &amp; little, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the gouerment of the hou≈øe, to the intent to put him in his roome receiueth therby wonderful countentment, and thinketh him≈øelfe in mind much bound vnto him, &amp; not onely honoreth him, but witheth him long to liue on earth.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond is the commoditie of the ≈øonne, who by this meanes, after his fathers death, ≈øhall haue no neede to ≈øeeke coun≈øel at his friends &amp; kin≈øfolks hands nor to put the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his hou≈øe to the di≈øcretion of his ≈øeruants, hauing by the fore≈øight of his father, at things long before in his owne hands, ≈øo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouerment of his hou≈øe ≈øhall not be ≈øtrange
<pb facs="tcp:5364:29"/>nor trouble≈øome vnto him, as it is to many, when they haue lo≈øt their Father.</p>
            <p>The third, is the ≈øweete re≈øt, and content of minde, which the Father inioyeth in his old dayes, both for that he feeleth him≈øelfe ridde from all worldly troubles; and be≈øides ≈øeeth his Sonne by his example, gouerne his hou≈øe orderly: and for my part, I count it the chiefe≈øt felicitie in this world, for a man to haue about him a number of goodly Children, which are growne to perfection; whom he may tearme the light of his eyes, and the ≈øtaffe of his age: and mee thikes it mu≈øt needes be a greater comfort to the Father to ≈øee a proofe of his Childe, and how di≈øcreetly he can di≈øpo≈øe of his lyuing, and order his hou≈øhould, then to doe it him≈ølefe: now when the Father ≈øhall be arriued to the hauen of ≈øuch happine≈ø≈øe, mee thinkes he may ioyfully looke for the la≈øt hower of his life, and die mo≈øt contentedly.</p>
            <p>Yet in the holy Scriptures in it written: <hi>Giue no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer thee; neither to thy Sonne, neither to thy Wife, neither to thy Brother, nor to thy Friend: and giue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy liuing to another, while thou art aliue, lea≈øt thou afterward repent it:</hi> Yet there haue been in time pa≈øt, and are at this day, many wi≈øe Fathers, which depart with their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges to their Children, and yet incurre no inconuenience by it; mary they doe it in ≈øuch ≈øort, that they neither bring them≈øelues in ≈øubiection to their Children, nor into ≈øuch ca≈øe, that they are not able to liue without them.</p>
            <p>But now in briefe, I giue the Father to vnder≈øtand, that there is nothing in this world, wherein there ought more care and diligence to be be≈øtowed, then in the bringing vp of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for thereof proceedeth for the mo≈øt part, either the mayntenance, or the decay of Hou≈øes: therefore he mu≈øt begin in time, to furni≈øh their tender mindes with the feare and knowledge of God, and ≈øuch good conditions, that they may learne to liue, as if they were ≈øtill at the poynt to die: that he indeauour to keepe them in obeydience, rather by loue

            <p>That he enter not into rage and impatience with his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; tor a good Father v≈øeth Wi≈øedome in ≈øtead of Anger, and awardeth a ≈ømall puni≈øhment for a great fauit; and yet is not ≈øo fooli≈øh pittifull altogether to pardon it, knowing that as by ≈øparing the Rodde he may ≈øpill his Child; ≈øo by wearing it too much, he make him either dull, or de≈øperat.</p>
            <p>That he prouide them of good Mai≈øters to teach them; for young Children mu≈øt be propped vp like young Trees, lea≈øt the tempe≈øt of Uices either breake them, or bow them crooked.</p>
            <p>That he ≈øuffer them not in any wi≈øe to haunt the company of ≈øuch people as will corrupt with wanton ≈øpeaches, and naughtie conditions.</p>
            <p>That he be carefull to marke in their childhoode, to what kind of life they are naturally inclyned, that he may di≈øigently ≈øet them vnto it: for an vntoward beginning, hath euer an vnluckie ending.</p>
            <p>That without iu≈øt occa≈øion, he v≈øe no partiallitie among≈øt his Children, vnle≈ø≈øe he be willing to ≈øet them together by the eares.</p>
            <p>That in all his doinges, hee ≈øhew him≈øelfe graue and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt: and by doing well him ≈øelfe, giue his Children an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to doe the like: that in his olde age when his Sonnes are growen men, thorough couetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, hee witholde not from them rea≈øonable ≈øtipendes to liue by: otherwi≈øe in ≈øtead in honouring him, they will wi≈øh him buried.</p>
            <p>Finally, that he be ≈øo carefull ouer his Children, that at his death, hee feele not his con≈øcience charged in hauing to make account for his necligence in their behalfe: per≈øwading

            <p>Fir≈øt, not to ≈øuffer a Mayde to go abroad but once or twi≈øe in a yeare, is the way to make her become fooli≈øh, fearefull, and out of countenance in compante.</p>
            <p>Now the other, which goeth abrode euery day with her Mother, and haunteth Fea≈øtes and Banquets, melteth away like Ware in the fire; and driuing by little and little the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly mode≈øty, out of her lookes and ge≈øtures, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in her a licencious and wanton behauiour; ≈øo that ≈øhe is rather taken for a Mother, then a Mayde: and if there come no wor≈øe of it, the Mother may a≈ø≈øure her ≈øelfe, that in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Daughter ≈øo often abroad in publicke places, maketh her thereby le≈ø≈øe prized, and wor≈øe be≈øtowed, then otherwi≈øe ≈øhee might bee.</p>
            <p>I ≈øay nothing of the≈øe that are taught in their Chambers to write, to read, and ≈øing, and neuer come downe into the Kitchin; but I will leaue that charge to the poore Hu≈øhands, who≈øe Hau≈øe goeth to decay, and all for hauing ≈øo learned a wife.</p>
            <p>Then if you ca≈øt your eyes vpon one of tho≈øe which can do nothing but ≈øow, &amp; ≈øpinne; you ≈øhall ≈øee in attyre, in talke, and in behauiour, the very figure of a countrie Milkemayde, who will haue as good a grace among≈øt other women, as a Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen≈øtuff-wench among≈øt courtly Ladyes.</p>
            <p>It behooueth then all di≈øcreete Fathers, who are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtow their Daughters in Mariage, to con≈øider of what cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:5364:32"/>his Sonne in law is like to bee, and ≈øo to frame his Daughter accordingly: as, if he purpo≈øe to marry her into the Countrey, to bring her vp in Countrey hu≈øwiterie. If the Fahter meane to marry his Daughter to a Courtier, he mu≈øt ≈øet her to the Court to the ≈øeruice of ≈øome great Lady, and mu≈øt be learned to read to write, to di≈øcour≈øe, to ≈øing, to play on In≈øtruments, to daunce, and to be able to performe all that, which belongeth to a Courtier to do: by this meanes many are marryed to great Gentlemen, without one penny dowrie giuen by their Father.</p>
            <p>Some (I know) will alleadge, that the Father hath not alwayes his Sanne in law in his ≈øleeue; for indeede Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages are made in Heauen, and are guided by De≈øtenie; ≈øo that the Father may be tenne yeares in brewing a matter, which in a moment he may be driuen to change: therefore to conclude this matter touching Daughters, I can giue no fitter aduerti≈øement then this; that the Fathers be≈øtow all their ≈øtudie and diligence, to bring them vp cha≈øt, as well in body as in minde: for a man waigheth it not much to haue the fle≈øh vn≈øpotted, if the minde be defiled; and therefore it is needfull to put into their heartes godly imaginations, that from their inward puritie, there may ≈øhine outward mode≈øtie; and for that Beautie is a frayle and dangerous thing, tho≈øe which are beautifull, haue ≈øo much the more need of that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to keepe their Beautie vnblemi≈øhed, for Beautie in an vncha≈øt Woman, ferueth to no more purpo≈øe, then a golde Ring in a Swines ≈ønowte.</p>

            <p>He that will be a Mai≈øter &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder of Families, mu≈øt as well know how to ≈øerue and obey, as to controule and commaunde; for it is not ≈øo ea≈øie a matter to know how to commaunde, as to be a Mai≈øter: and although there be few that take vpon them the right cour≈øe of a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, and can doe that, which belongeth vnto them to doe; yet almo≈øt in euery Hou≈øe, Mai≈øters are ≈øo vndi≈øcreete, proude, fanta≈øticall, and in≈øolent, that they v≈øe their Seruantes no otherwi≈øe, then if they were ≈ølaues, ≈øpeakeing imperiou≈øly to them; beeing not content, vnle≈ø≈øe they ≈øee them tremble in their pre≈øence; v≈øing no ≈øpeach vnto them, but full of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, threatning, and reuiling.</p>
            <p>By ≈øuch maner of dealing, it commeth to pa≈ø≈øe, that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, though good and ≈øufficient, begin to grow naught, and to waxe coole in good-will, and necligent in duetie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardes their Mai≈øters: But tho≈øe Mai≈øters are more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øcreete, which brawle and chide with their Seruantes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øtraungers, whereby in minde they make the ≈øtraungers thinke they are ≈øcarce welcome to their hou≈øe; and be≈øides, thereby ≈øpight their Seruants the mo≈øt of any thing in the
<pb facs="tcp:5364:33"/>world: for proofe whereof, when a Seruant ≈øeeketh a pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, he neuer inquireth whether he be of an euill life; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be hard to plea≈øe or no:</p>
            <p>But in my minde yet, tho≈øe are wor≈øe, which ≈øpeake to their Seruantes with their handes; who belike, haue been beaten by their Mai≈øters, whom they ≈øerued before time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will reuenge it vpon their Seruantes then beeing. Other Mai≈øters are of this fond humor, that they will haue their Seruants vnder≈øtande their minde, in making onely a ≈øigne, as if them≈øelues were dumbe, and their Seruants di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiners. Some will haue their Seruantes doe three or foure things at once, ot hauing the iudgement to con≈øider, that (as a Sexton ≈øayd) a man can not carry the Cro≈ø≈øe, and ring the Belles together. Some are ≈øo curious, that if they had a thou≈øand Seruantes, they would trouble them all, and neuer be content; for that none of them all can plea≈øe them: who≈øe fa≈øhion it is euery month to change a Seruant.</p>
            <p>Wee haue in London heere, a Gentleman whom I well know, who about ≈øixe moneths ≈øince, be≈øtowed vpon a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of his, a Liuerie cloake: which ≈øince that time, hee hath be≈øtowed vpon foure others, and taken it ≈øtill from them againe. In this humor be many Mai≈øters now adayes: But to returne to our Philo≈øophicall Di≈øcour≈øe againe.</p>
            <p>The Mai≈øter that often changeth his Seruants, receiueth great di≈øhonour thereby; and withall, ≈øheweth him≈øelfe an impatient man, and hard to plea≈øe; and be≈øides, ≈øpreadeth his ≈øecretes and doings the farther abrode: for when a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant departeth from his Mai≈øter, in what ≈øort ≈øoeuer it be, whether contented or di≈øcontented, hee cannot refraine from reporting where ≈øo euer he goe, the life and behauiour of his former Mai≈øter: and though with one troth, he mingle a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred lyes, yet there be enough that will beleeue him: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, the Mai≈øter is troubled to tune his new Seruants to his fancie.</p>

            <p>This brings into my mind a plea≈øant ≈øtory of a Spani≈øh Gentleman that had one day good tryall of the good wit of a new come ≈øeruant, which Gentleman hanging ≈øent his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øeruants about other bu≈øines, after be had mate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er, yet his ≈øeruant ≈øet two trenchers on the the table, and two ≈øtooles, the one again≈øt the other, the Gentleman ≈øayd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, but ≈øu≈øpecting the meaning of his new come man, attended the end of the play: meate being brought in, ≈øo ≈øoone as his man bad giuen him water, he wa≈øht and ≈øat him downe, which he bad no ≈øooner done, but his man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing likewi≈øe wa≈øht, ≈øat him down right ouer again≈øt him: the Gentleman being naturally eluen to be mery kept his countenance, and let his man alone hauing eaten a while friendly together, the man began to thinke him, how his ma≈øter might perchannce be a thir≈øt: wherevpon be ≈øait, ma≈øter, when you will orinke, I pray you make curte≈øie to commaund me, whereat the Gentleman lought ≈øo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that the poore foole knowing his fault, ro≈øe to fetch him drinke, but would fit downe no more.</p>
            <p>But now to returne againe to our matter, that Ma≈øter who will be well ≈øerued, mu≈øt not be ≈øparing of his ≈øpeech, as well to commaund what he will haue done, as gently to in≈øtruct his Seruant in that wherein he is ignorant, by
<pb facs="tcp:5364:36"/>telling him of his fault.</p>
            <p>Therefore if he will haue his ≈øeruant carefull and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his ≈øeruice he mu≈øt likewi≈øe him≈øelfe be carefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his bu≈øines for there is nothing that more awaketh the ≈øeruants then the diligence of the ma≈øter, as one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide it is impo≈ø≈øible, the Seruant ≈øhould be diligent if the Ma≈øter be negligent: And therevpon it is ≈øaid, that the eye of the ma≈øter fatteth the hor≈øe to which purpo≈øe a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øopher being a≈økt which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, to make land bring good ≈øtore of corne, an≈øwered, for the ma≈øter to walke often about, which is to ≈øae it him≈øelfe without tru≈øting to his ≈øeruants: Moreouer he mu≈øt v≈øe his authoritie in ≈øuch ≈øort, that he may be better ≈øerued with the turning of his eye, then others are with threatning words.</p>
            <p>But now when the ma≈øter knoweth he hath gotten the loue and fidelitie of his ≈øeruant, he mu≈øt be carefull in any wi≈øe to keepe it, where vnto there is nothing of more force, then to v≈øe him curteou≈øly: ayding him in his troubles, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiting him in his ≈øicknes, and be≈øtowing on him when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion ≈øhall ≈øerue, that which ≈øhall co≈øt the ma≈øter little, and plea≈øure the ≈øeruant much: Therefore let him not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to reward the good ≈øeruant, and keepe him alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him as a pretious thing, remembring that there is nothing in this life, more nece≈ø≈øarie then a good Seruant: Let him be to thee as thine own ≈øoule, take not ≈øcorne ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to beare his rea≈øons, and gouerne thy ≈øelfe according to his faithfull adutie, for that there haue beene found ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, which haue more profitted their mai≈øters hou≈øe, then his Brothers or Children haue.</p>
            <p>Likewi≈øe giue charge to the Seruant, this le≈ø≈øon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that be take beede of failing into the common error of Seruants, who like a new broome which ≈øweepeth the hou≈øe cleane ≈øerue diligently at the fir≈øt, but after grow ≈ølothfull, that is not the way to get fauour, for not be which beginneth well is worthy of recompence, but he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in well doing: for the mai≈øter will looke that his
